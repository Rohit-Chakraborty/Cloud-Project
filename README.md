Vehicle Trajectory Prediction with Graph Attentive Tokenization and Transformer
Overview
This project focuses on predicting the trajectories of vehicles based on graph attention mechanisms and transformer models. Vehicle trajectories are modeled using a graph structure where each vehicle represents a node, defined by specific parameters, and the spatial relationship between vehicles is captured as edges. A transformer module is employed to enhance the predictive accuracy by refining the representation of the trajectory.

Project Structure
Graph Construction: The input data for the vehicle trajectory is organized in a graph structure where:

Each node represents a vehicle and is defined by four selected parameters that influence the trajectory prediction.
Each edge captures the distance between vehicles, representing the relative spatial relationships and interactions among them.
Graph Attentive Tokenization: Graph attention mechanisms are applied to this structure to capture dynamic relationships. This allows the model to focus on significant nodes and edges, thereby improving the representation of interactions between vehicles.

Transformer Module: A transformer model is then used to process the graph structure. Transformers are effective for sequence prediction tasks, and in this project, they play a crucial role in refining and enhancing the trajectory predictions. The transformer's attention mechanism helps to focus on critical parts of the trajectory, learning dependencies across the spatial-temporal interactions represented in the graph.

Key Components
Node Representation: Each node in the graph is defined by four specific parameters. These parameters encapsulate essential information about each vehicle, contributing to the overall prediction accuracy.

Edge Representation: The distance between vehicles is encoded as an edge, helping to capture the influence of nearby vehicles on each node’s trajectory.

Graph Attention Layer: This layer applies attention mechanisms on the graph, allowing the model to weigh the importance of different nodes and edges in the trajectory prediction task.

Transformer Module: A transformer module refines the representations learned by the graph attention layer, enhancing the model’s ability to capture both spatial and temporal dependencies.
